h1. Templates

Created by Sean Cribbs, September 2007 -- Refactored, August 2008

Templates provide internal structure to Radiant pages to create an extra layer
of flexibility in Layout development.  This is accomplished by:

 * Specifying the Layout and page class that will be used by pages with a
   given template
 * Specifying the parts and their filters that will be editable in the
   page interface
 * Specifying the "type" of each part, allowing customization of the editing
   UI
 * Adding a popup menu to the site map in which a template for a new
   page can be chosen

The templates extension requires Radiant 0.6.7 or later, preferred 0.6.9 or
later. It has worked with earlier versions of Radiant, but is not guaranteed
to run on them and would require the "shards" extension.

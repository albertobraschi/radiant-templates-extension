= Templates

Created by Sean Cribbs, September 2007

Templates provide internal structure to Radiant pages to create an extra layer 
of flexibility in Layout development.  This is accomplished by:

 * Specifying the Layout that will be used by pages with a given template
 * Specifying the parts (and their filters) that will be editable in the 
   page interface
 * Adding a popup menu to the site map in which a template for a new
   page can be chosen

The templates extension requires Radiant 0.6.7 or later, preferred 0.6.9 or 
later.
